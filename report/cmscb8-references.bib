  abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomic analysis is widely used to study human tumors. However it remains challenging to distinguish normal cell types in the tumor microenvironment from malignant cells and to resolve clonal substructure within the tumor. To address these challenges, we developed an integrative Bayesian segmentation approach called CopyKAT (Copynumber Karyotyping of Aneuploid Tumors) to estimate genomic copy number profiles at an average genomic resolution of 5Mb from read depth in high-throughput scRNA-seq data. We applied CopyKAT to analyze 46,501 single cells from 21 tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, anaplastic thyroid cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma and glioblastoma to accurately (98\%) distinguish cancer cells from normal cell types. In three breast tumors, CopyKAT resolved clonal subpopulations that differed in the expression of cancer genes such as KRAS and signatures including EMT, DNA repair, apoptosis and hypoxia. These data show that CopyKAT can aid the analysis of scRNA-seq data in a variety of solid human tumors.},

Here we present epiAneufinder, an algorithm that exploits the read count information from scATAC-seq data to extract genome-wide copy number alterations (CNAs) for individual cells, allowing the study of CNA heterogeneity present in a sample at the single-cell level. Using different cancer scATAC-seq datasets, we show that epiAneufinder can identify intratumor clonal heterogeneity in populations of single cells based on their CNA profiles. We demonstrate that these profiles are concordant with the ones inferred from single-cell whole genome sequencing data for the same samples. EpiAneufinder allows the inference of single-cell CNA information from scATAC-seq data, without the need of additional experiments, unlocking a layer of genomic variation which is otherwise unexplored.},

  abstract = {The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enabled a flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks.  Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements.  Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured, high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what are the relevant factors and how they work together.  Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach; AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency map.},

  abstract = {Histone modifications are among the most important factors that control gene regulation. Computational methods that predict gene expression from histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their combinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing `epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifying the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels either failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods that separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a unified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to classify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system, called DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among important features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions among histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique that generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides an intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate genes.We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art models like Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expression classification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database. The output of our visualization technique not only validates the previous observations but also allows novel insights about combinatorial interactions among histone modification marks, some of which have recently been observed by experimental studies.Codes and results are available at www.deepchrome.orgyanjun@virginia.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We focus on the task of predicting gene expression from the intensity of histone modifications. The proposed RCNN architecture can be applied to data of an arbitrary size, and has a single meta-parameter that quantifies the models capacity, thus making it flexible for experimenting. The proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art systems, while having several orders of magnitude fewer parameters.},

  abstract = {Chromatin accessibility is essential in regulating gene expression and cellular identity, and alterations in accessibility have been implicated in driving cancer initiation, progression and metastasis1--4. Although the genetic contributions to oncogenic transitions have been investigated, epigenetic drivers remain less understood. Here we constructed a pan-cancer epigenetic and transcriptomic atlas using single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data (using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin) from 225 samples and matched single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-sequencing expression data from 206 samples. With over 1\,million cells from each platform analysed through the enrichment of accessible chromatin regions, transcription factor motifs and regulons, we identified epigenetic drivers associated with cancer transitions. Some epigenetic drivers appeared in multiple cancers (for example, regulatory regions of ABCC1 and VEGFA; GATA6 and FOX-family motifs), whereas others were cancer specific (for example, regulatory regions of FGF19, ASAP2 and EN1, and the PBX3 motif). Among epigenetically altered pathways, TP53, hypoxia and TNF signalling were linked to cancer initiation, whereas oestrogen response, epithelial--mesenchymal transition and apical junction were tied to metastatic transition. Furthermore, we revealed a marked correlation between enhancer accessibility and gene expression and uncovered cooperation between epigenetic and genetic drivers. This atlas provides a foundation for further investigation of epigenetic dynamics in cancer transitions.},

  abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) frequently features a high level of tumor heterogeneity. Elucidating the chromatin landscape of ccRCC at the single-cell level could provide a deeper understanding of the functional states and regulatory dynamics underlying the disease. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) on 19 ccRCC samples, and whole-exome sequencing was used to understand the heterogeneity between individuals. Single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility maps of ccRCC were constructed to reveal the regulatory characteristics of different tumor cell subtypes in ccRCC. Two long noncoding RNAs (RP11-661C8.2 and CTB-164N12.1) were identified that promoted the invasion and migration of ccRCC, which was validated with in vitro experiments. Taken together, this study comprehensively characterized the gene expression and DNA regulation landscape of ccRCC, which could provide new insights into the biology and treatment of ccRCC.A comprehensive analysis of gene expression and DNA regulation in ccRCC using scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq reveals the DNA regulatory programs of ccRCC at the single-cell level.},
